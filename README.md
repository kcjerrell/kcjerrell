#### Who I am
I have been coding/programming since I was in junior high (that's... we'll say at least 20 years ago). It's something I've kept up as a hobby thoughout my life - mostly just pet projects, automation, transforming data and hacking bits together. But now I'm dedicating myself into making a career of it! I'm passionate about writing clean code, always eager to learn new languages/platforms/libraries, and am ready for new challenges.

#### What I am doing
I'm currently wrapping up the last of my education at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), working on a project for [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/) called Blue Witness. It's an app for tracking and documenting police use-of-force incidents in the United States - and I am one of the frontend engineers. After working on a couple bug fixes and minor features - I dived into [gutting the AdminDashboard](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/human-rights-first-police-fe-a/pull/363). Refactoring and repurposing subcomponents, eliminating prop-drilling, and generating cleaner, more maintainable code. Next up, rebuilding the Redux store!

#### What I want to do
After an aimless and mediocre 'career' in retail - I'm making the jump! I'm actively seeking any position as a developer - frontend, backend, or otherwise.
