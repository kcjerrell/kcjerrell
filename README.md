#### Who I am
I have been coding/programming since I was in junior high (that's... we'll say at least 20 years ago). It's something I've kept up as a hobby throughout my life - mostly just pet projects, automation, transforming data, and hacking bits together. After an aimless and mediocre 'career' in retail, I used quarantine and my stimulus money to invest in myself and pursue coding professionally. I attended Lambda School, an online coding bootcamp, and in my final week of Labs accepted an offer to work for a little start-up called QA Wolf.

#### What I am doing
I am currently QA Automation Lead for QA Wolf. No longer a scrappy, little start-up, QA Wolf has grown over the past year from just 7 people to a team of over 45! I spend my day developing and improving our QA Engineering Team's internal tools, helping streamline their workflows to serve our growing client-base and manage their automated test suites.

#### What I want to do
My primary career goal is to continue my trajectory with QA Wolf - becoming a better developer every day and helping this team own the space and become the 'operating system for quality' for our clients.
