I have been coding/programming since I was in junior high (that's... we'll say at least 20 years ago). It's something I've kept up as a hobby throughout my life - mostly just pet projects, automation, transforming data, and hacking bits together. After a mediocre 'career' in retail, I used quarantine to invest in myself and pursue coding professionally. I attended Lambda School, an online coding bootcamp, and in my final week of Labs accepted an offer to work for a start-up called QA Wolf.

Quickly becoming their first QA Lead, and then QA Automation Lead, I led efforts to develop and improve their QA Engineering Team's internal tools, helping streamline their workflows to serve their growing client-base and manage their automated test suites.

I'm currently seeking new opportunities to grow as a developer. I'm passionate about code and code quality, and love learning new languages and technologies. I'm self-motivated and take pride in delivering robust, effective solutions.

I have experience in developing TypeScript React applications. I enjoy building with NextJS and Prisma, and working with a team to iterate as requirements change. I also have a strong testing background, not just with Jest, but especially E2E tests using Playwright as well.

I look forward to hearing from you!
